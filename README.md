Drone Surveillance and Image Capture- 
The Real-Time Drone Surveillance project enables autonomous aerial monitoring, equipped with the 
capability to capture high-quality images. Built using Computer Vision, the project integrates 
advanced modules such as cv2 (OpenCV) for image processing, djitellopy for controlling and 
communicating with DJI Tello drones, KeyPressModule for intuitive control via keyboard, and time 
for managing flight and capture intervals. This system allows the drone to perform efficient, real-time 
surveillance, making it a powerful tool for security, monitoring, and reconnaissance operations. The 
integration of image capture enhances its versatility for a variety of applications.
